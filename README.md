# Bayesian Scalar-on-Function Models for Functional Data with Wearable Applications

## Project for Bayesian statistics course, a.y. 2023/2024, Politecnico di Milano
The primary objective of the project was to develop a Scalar-on-Function regression model using a bayesian approach. Initially, we constructed both unconstrained and constrained models, following the methodology outlined in the paper referenced by https://doi.org/10.1111/stan.12322. This involved leveraging the concepts of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and conducting Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations.

Prior to applying these models to real-world data, we evaluated their performance using synthetic data. The real data utilized in our study were sourced from the Personalized Parkinson Project, conducted at the Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands between 2017 and 2023 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-019-1394-3).

Finally, we conducted an analysis to identify any mixed effects present within this dataset, with a specific focus on variables such as gender and the treatment levels of individual patients.
